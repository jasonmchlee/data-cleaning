    "# R, Data Cleaning\n",
    "As you continue working with data, though, you'll find that much of the data you encounter will be messy, and lots of your time will be spent preparing it for analysis. These preparations, known as data cleaning, include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing data you don't need for your analysis\n",
    "2. Removing duplicate data\n",
    "3. Dealing with missing data and outliers\n",
    "4. Creating new variables where necessary\n",
    "5. Combining separate data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is often a non-linear process. You'll need to spend time researching your data, use your professional judgement to make decisions, and sometimes revisit your data cleaning choices mid-project. That's okay: Data cleaning is a crucial part of being a data analyst or scientist, and getting good at it takes practice.\n",
